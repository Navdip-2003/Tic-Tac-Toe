# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the grid is full without any player winning (a draw).

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** The game features a clean and interactive user interface built with React.
- **Real-time Updates:** The game state updates in real-time as players take their turns.
- **Win Detection:** The game detects and announces when a player wins or if there is a draw.
- **Restart Option:** Players can restart the game at any time.
